# multi-feature-discord-bot-Python
a python discord bot that can do several taks including sending a random fact upon request, tell you how many members in the server, tell you a random word plus its definition and find the latest video from a youtube channel.

a bit of inspiration was taken from a stack overflow post:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15512239/python-get-all-youtube-video-urls-of-a-channel
use the script called keep_alive.py to keep the script running on a webserver so even when you turn your pc off, the script remains running.
